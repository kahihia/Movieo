>> Discussion
* How to start?
 * The Project envolves a fair amount of sentiment analysis
 * Data for the analysis is sourced from open platforms/social platforms wherever it is available.
 * Facebook Graph APIs and Twitter APIs will be the source for our data.
 * We need to fetch data from these social websites according to some tags, keywords like movie names and celebrities.
 * As happens in Zomato, person on signing up on Movieo will be automatically following his Facebook friends.
 * Login only through Facebook and keep them in our database, once they log in.

* Discussion Technologies:
 * Nodejs can't be used here as it is not be able to handle complex features but is good for scalability purposes. 

	
> Action Points

 * Learn how to use APIs.
 * GET/POST etc. methods.
 * Basic understanding of REST APIs.
 * By next time, we'll be given wireframes too.
