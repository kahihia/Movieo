##Brief Problem Statement
Movieo is a Social community for Movie Lovers. It is the first Indian platform dedicated to movie lovers which focuses on Movie Fans (Moviegoers) rather than critics. The platform would source data from various social platforms and predicts the success and returns of the movie based on sentiment analysis. It would analyze various aspects of the movie in details such as Plot, Cinematography, Music, Script, etc based on user reviews. This platform would enable users to review movies themselves and other users can view them. This would enable significant contributions by Movie Lovers instead of critics, whose views can sometimes be biased.
 
Movieo also allows movie goers to connect with each other. The basic idea behind MOVIEO is to create a consolidated movie viewing experience. It also integrates the reviews and comments of celebrities worldwide on trending movies across the globe in the form of tweets and Facebook posts.
